# EasySelect: Your One-Stop Tool for Managing and Manipulating Data Across File Formats (Excel, CSV, JSON).


EasySelect is a user-friendly Python application designed to simplify data management by allowing you to select, transfer, and summarize columns across common file formats (Excel, CSV, JSON). This tool empowers you to effectively manipulate your data, without requiring any programming knowledge. It's made mainly to make working on Excel and other files like CSV or JSON and make an easier interaction between them as transferring the data
from one file to the another.


**Features:**

* Script written in classes, to make it easier for readability and improvement in terms of adding a new feature.

* Supports various file formats: Excel (.xlsx), CSV, and JSON.

* Intuitive interface, that enables easy selection of desired columns and values.

* Generates summaries of chosen columns, for quick data analysis.

* Saves data modifications to the user-specified file format.

* Planned desktop application (GUI), for a user-friendly interaction (will be added soon).

* Create a graph, using plot library (will be added soon).

* Create a user interference (would be grateful for help here).

* Create a tool in a way, that it would be easy-usable for people with different disabilities.

* Added test.py, for testing functions that are in the code.


**What the code is doing now already?**


For this moment (12.08.2024) the script can do:


* Open any .xlsx, .JSON or .csv file that would be in the same directory as the script.

* Look for named file (with the extension) in whole computer memory, and enum every file, so you could choose it by entering a correct number.

* Giving possibility to "extract" the columns, with their data, from the main file to the file that We want to create.

* Save the file as the .xlsx, .JSON or .csv (it will be added in the following days).

* Allowing to create charts right after creating new file and save them in the newly created folder.

* Giving option to choose scheet from which you want to obtain data.

** Know Problems: **




** Want I want to add : **

* Make script "transfer" to classes, so it will be correct with OOP, and will allow for more flexibility on expanding the code.

* Allowing to work on .txt and .ods files, and also SQL files.

* Make possibility in terms of workin on Power Bi files.

* Allow edition of charts.



Working on transfer all functions from script based style to class based, and make it more OOP.


For Data Analyst :

   I want to expand this script, to include new functionality for data analysts using the Pandas library. 
   This should allow users to locate the desired file and then extrapolate data based on an attribute provided by the user.
