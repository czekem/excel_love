# EasySelect: Your One-Stop Tool for Managing and Manipulating Data Across File Formats (Excel, CSV, JSON)

EasySelect is a user-friendly Python application designed to simplify data management by allowing you to select, transfer, and summarize columns across common file formats (Excel, CSV, JSON). This tool empowers you to effectively manipulate your data without requiring any programming knowledge. It's made mainly to make working on excel and other files like csv or json and make an easier interaction between them as transfering the data
from one file to the another.

**Features:**

* Supports various file formats: Excel (.xlsx), CSV, and JSON
* Intuitive interface enables easy selection of desired columns and values
* Generates summaries of chosen columns for quick data analysis
* Saves data modifications to the user-specified file format
* Planned desktop application (GUI) for user-friendly interaction (will be added soon)
* Create a graphs using plotly library ( will be added soon)
* Create an user interferance ( would be grateful for help here)

**What the code is doing now already?**

For this moment (13.03.2024) the script can do :

* Open any .xlsx, .json or .csv file that would be in the same directory as the script
* Look for named file ( with the extension) in whole computer memory, and enum every file, so you  could choose it by entering a correct number
* Giving possiblity to "extract" the columns with their data from the main file to the file that We want to create
* Save the file as the .xlsx, .json or .csv ( it will be added in the following days)
