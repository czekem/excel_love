# excel_love
Building user tool for selecting &amp; transferring columns across Excel, CSV &amp; JSON files. Enables data manipulation and API potential
If I will have a little bit of luck ( and skills), I want also try to make a deskopt app of this tool.


BTW. I will try to change the name later on the " from_excel_with_love"

The thing I want this program to do:

-Managing ever .csv, .xlsx, or .json and make it possible to work on.
-Allowing user to choose which columns/values he want to work on.
